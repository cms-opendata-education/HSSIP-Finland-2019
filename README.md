# HSSIP-Finland-2019
Open data exercises from CERN High School Student Internship program

These notebooks were produced during our intership programme in CERN. We started by going through teaching material in Jupyter notebook and gradually learnt how to use Python by doing different exercises. Next phase was to create own data and tested how we could produce a nice histogram about pendulum movement. We also searched open data from online and created histograms about different materials. Now we were ready to face new challenges and wanted to find the W-boson from Cern's data. Each one of us created a histogram with different variables and combined them in the end.

Here I have presented how popular certains names have been in USA during 2019 and how places where you can rent a bicycle are located in Vantaa in form of a histogram.

By opening this file you can find a sinwave that changes its color from red to purple. Here I have also plotted a basic circle and two ellipses.

I wanted to test something new and created a snowman with a slider that changes the shape of its mouth. You can test it and change its mood or make it wave its hands.
