# HSSIP-Finland-2019
Open data exercises from CERN High School Student Internship program

These notebooks were produced during our 2 week intership programme in CERN. We started by going through the teaching materials with Jupyter notebook thus learning the basics of Python with different excercises. After getting used to Python as a programming language, we proceeded to create our own data. We produced the data with Phyphox and used Python to create histograms of pendulum movement. In addition, we also searched for open data online and used the data we found to produce different graphs (bar charts, xy-scatters etc.). In this phase we focused more on the visual side of the charts to make them easier to understand.

After facing a variety of challenges with the open data we found online, we were ready to analyze actual data from the CMS. We wanted to use CERN's open data to find the W-boson. Each of us created their own histograms with different variables and conditions. We then combined our work to create the final outcome.

Here I have presented how popular certains names have been in USA during 2019 and how places, where you can rent a bicycle, are located in Vantaa in form of a histogram.

Here I have presented a number of road accidents in Finland during 2017 and how they occured.

I was interested how capable Python is creating pictures and shapes, and here are my results. I plotted a smileyface, a pig from Angry Birds and few colorfull circles.

By opening this file, you can find a sinwave that changes its color from red to purple. Here I have also plotted a basic circle and two ellipses.

I wanted to test something new and created a snowman with a slider that changes the shape of its mouth. You can test it and change its mood or make it wave its hands.
